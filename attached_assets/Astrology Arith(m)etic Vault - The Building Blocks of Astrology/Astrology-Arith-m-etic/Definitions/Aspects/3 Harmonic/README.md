### 🌐 What are Harmonics?

**Harmonics** are divisions of the zodiac wheel that reveal archetypal geometry and the vibrational relationships between planetary bodies. Each harmonic is a frequency.

Examples:
- **2nd Harmonic (180° Opposition)** – Polarized tension, duality
- **3rd Harmonic (120° Trine)** – Harmony, talent, natural flow
- **4th Harmonic (90° Square)** – Challenge, inner pressure, evolution
- **5th Harmonic (72° Quintile)** – Creative genius, technical brilliance
- **6th Harmonic (60° Sextile)** – Movement, opportunity, agreement

These aspects form the **core framework** of both traditional and harmonic astrology and are essential to **Astrology Arith(m)etic’s frequency-mapping system**.
