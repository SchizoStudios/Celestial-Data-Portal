Welcome to the **Aspects** directory — one of the core atomic structures of the Astrology Arith(m)etic system.

This folder contains subfolders that group planetary aspects by harmonic families and geometric frequency. These files are the groundwork for interpreting planetary relationships — angular distances between celestial bodies that form the energetic latticework of every chart. Each aspect carries a distinct frequency, function and psychological/metaphysical tone.

# What are Aspects?

Aspects are angular relationships between two or more planets and/or points in a chart, measured in degrees.  They are the vibrtational geometry of astrology, influencing how planetary energies combine, clash, or synergize.  Aspects reveal **activation points** in the psyche, soul path, and lived experience.

In Astrology Arith(m)etic, aspects are treated as **modular units of archetypal interaction**.  Each folder within this directory represents a spcific aspect family or harmonic type.

# Folder Categories

## Harmonic

This category includs aspects derived from **dividing the 360° circle by whole numbers** — forming the basis of harmonic astrology.

Each harmonic yields a family of aspects with ist own core vibration:
- **2nd Harmonic:** Opposition (180°), Duality, Reflection
- **3rd Harmonic:** Trine (120°), Flow, Talent
- **4th Harmonic:** Square (90°), Tension, Growth
- **5th Harmonic:** Quintile (72°), Creative Genius
- **6th Harmonic:** Sextile (60°), Opportunity, Movement

These divisions are based on **resonant math** and form the structure of frequency-based aspect interpretation.

## Septile Family

The **Septile (51.43°)** and its related angles arise from dividing the circle by **7**, a number long associated with sacred or mystical symbolism. This family includes:
-**Septile (51.43°)** — fate, spiritual cumpolsion
-**Biseptile (102.86°)** — karmic tension, breakthrough
-**Trispetile (154.29°)** — spiritual alignment or disruption

These are **non-Ptolemaic aspects** and are often used in psychological, soul-based, or esoteric astrology. They are rare, subtle, and deeply patterned.

⸻

## Novile Family

From the **ninth harmonic**, novile aspects are about **fulfillment, spiritual learning, and inner completion**.

-**Novile (40°)** — sacred. Work, internal mastery
-**Binovile (80°)** — double growth
-**Trinovile (120°)** — overlap with trine energy but with a soul undertone

They resonate strongly in charts that show spiritual contracts, repetive life themes, or subtle callings.

⸻


## Decile Family

Based on the **10th harmonic** (360°/10), this family focuses on **personal ability** and **refined expression**.

-**Decile (36°)** — subtle skill or gift
-**Quindecile (165°)** — obsession, drive, compulsion *(especially in Magi or Noel Tyl’s astrology)*

This group explores psychic intensity and minor-but-critical life currents.

⸻

## Undecile & Vadecile

Aspects from the **11th harmonic** are rare and often used in high-weirdness or ultra-specific chart systems.

-**Undecile (32.73°)** — experimental insight, irregular genius
-**Vadecile (18°)** — a minor aspect of **curiosity**, **stimulus**, and **instability**.

These aspects are great for **odd-numbered rituals**, spiritual codes, or exsperimental intermretation techniques.

# Purpose in Astrology Arith(m)etic

This directory is a **core layer of the entire Astrology Arithetic system**, which is:
- A modular, expandable framework for astrological studies
- Designed to support CLI-based tools and future AI implementation
- Meant to be accessible, teachabe, and programmable for astrologers of all levels

Eventually, this folder will power:
- **Custom command-line packages** (e.g., ./aspect Mars Venus -date 06-09-2025)
- **AI LLM training** for interpretation generation
- **Scriptable metaphysical engines** and Obsidian-integrated prompts

Each aspect file can be thought of as a **semantic glyph** — a programmable, magical code.

# Naming Convention

Files within each folder follow the format:

[Aspect Name].md

Each Contains:
- Glyph
- Exact degree
- Orb tolerance
- Geometric origin
- Interpretations (mental, emotional, physical, spiritual)
- Use in natal, transits, progressions and ritual astrology.
