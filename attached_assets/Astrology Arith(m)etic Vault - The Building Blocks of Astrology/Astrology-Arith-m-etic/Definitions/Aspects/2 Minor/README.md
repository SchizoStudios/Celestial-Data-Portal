# ðŸŒ™ Minor Aspects

This folder includes aspects that are more **subtle, nuanced, and less frequently interpreted** than major aspects â€” but no less significant in specific contexts.

Each file in this folder follows the standard structure:
- **Degree of Aspect**
- **Degree Orbs**
- **Description**
- **Key Points**
- **Example**
- **Use in Practice**

## ðŸ§­ What Are Minor Aspects?

**Minor aspects** often originate from **less common harmonics** (e.g. 8th, 10th, 11th), or are derived from geometric midpoints between major aspects.

These aspects describe:
- **Subtle inner conflicts**
- **Hidden talents or motivations**
- **Specialty patterns that operate below the surface**

They are **crucial in high-resolution interpretation** and especially helpful when working with:
- Progressions and solar arc  
- Synastry overlays  
- Shadow work and integration astrology

### Included Minor Aspects May Include:
- **Semisextile (30Â°)**  
- **Semisquare (45Â°)**  
- **Sesquisquare (135Â°)**  
- **Quincunx / Inconjunct (150Â°)**  
- **Quindecile (165Â°)** (when interpreted psychologically)  
- **Undecile (32.73Â°)** or **Vadecile (18Â°)**  
- **Septile family aspects**, when treated subtly

## ðŸ§¬ Role in Astrology Arith(m)etic

Minor aspects act as the **fine structure of the astrological code** â€” the quantum grammar that shapes subtle behavior, inner conflict, or unusual genius.

In the future, these files will help develop:
- Command-line filters for chart tension thresholds  
- Fine-grain AI pattern detection  
- Unique aspect combinations for metaphysical ritual timing
