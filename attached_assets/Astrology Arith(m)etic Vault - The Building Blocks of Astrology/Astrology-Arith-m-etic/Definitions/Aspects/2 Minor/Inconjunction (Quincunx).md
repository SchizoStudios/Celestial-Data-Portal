**Aspect Degree:** 150
**Degree Orb:**
**Glyph:** ⚻

**Description:**
The inconjunction (also called quincunx) forms at 150 degrees. It connects planets that do not naturally understand each other, creating a sense of misalignment or adjustment. It calls for realignment, compromise, or healing.
This aspect tends to bring subtle but persistent pressure to change, recalibrate, or grow. Unlike oppositions or squares, the tension here is non-confrontational but still disruptive. It often expresses through discomfort that can’t be named directly, only felt or intuited. Healing often happens through awareness, integration, and/or somatic attention.

**Key Points:**
- Points to awkward or disjointed energies.
- Feels like things are “off” but not in direct conflict.
- Often involves health, recalibration, or fine-tuning.

**Example Interpretations:**
Moon inconjunct Saturn: Emotional needs vs. structural demands; a call to balance inner and outer duties.

**Use in Practice:**
In conjunctions are best approached with nonlinear soreness. When interpreting this aspect, look for where the chart-holder may be trying to juggle incompatible energies that aren’t naturally at odds but require growth to coesxist. It’s a signature of soul-level adjustment — not war, but a quit renovation. In ritual or healing work, inconjuncts may signal body-mound disconnects, ancestral imbalances, or karmic misalignments that can be eased through somatic, energetic, and/or integrative methods.
