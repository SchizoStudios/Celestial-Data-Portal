**Aspect Degree:** 90
**Degree Orbs:** 5-8°

**Description:**
A square forms when two planets or points are positioned 90 degrees apart, creating a dynamic and challenging angle. This aspect represents friction, tension, and obstacles that require effort to overcome. It’s often described as a “growth aspect,” because while it can feel uncomfortable, it forces action, problem-solving, and internal development.

**Key Traits:**
- Brings internal or external conflict that demands resolution.
- Acts as a catalyst for change, pushing you out of complacency.
- Often shows areas of blockage, resistance, or misalignment.
- Requires discipline and conscious effort to work through the challenge productively.

**Example Interpretation:**
Mars square Saturn: Effort meets resistance; tests of endurance and patience.
Venus square Neptune: Confusion in love or money; tension between idealism and reality.

**Use in Practice:**
Squares are activation points. Though they’re traditionally seen as “hard” aspects, they carry immense potential for breakthroughs and resilience. Leaning into the discomfort of a square helps build strength, clarity, and mastery over the issue at hand.
