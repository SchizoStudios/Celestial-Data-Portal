**Aspect Degree:** 120
**Aspect Orbs:** 6-8°
**Glyph:** △

**Description:**
A trine occurs when two planets or points are 120 degrees apart, forming one of the most harmonious and flowing aspects in astrology. Trines link planets in the same element (Fire, Earth, Air, or Water), allowing their energies to resonate naturally and effortlessly. This aspect promotes ease, talent, and grace, often working so smoothly that its benefits can be overlooked if taken for granted.

**Key Points:**
- Creates natural synergy and supports the unfolding of potential with minimal resistance.
- Indicates innate gifts, talents, and favorable circumstances.
- Can feel like the universe is providing “green lights” in the area it touches.
- Requires some awareness to avoid complacency or laziness (because it doesn’t push like a square).

**Example Interpretation:**
Sun trine Jupiter: Expansive confidence; luck and growth come easily.
Mars trine Pluto: Potent personal power; the ability to transform through action with deep effectiveness.

**Use in Practice**
Trines offer natural blessings and flow states. They’re best used by recognizing and amplifying the gifts they bring rather than letting them idle. This aspect supports creative expression, healing, and smooth progress in whatever area it touches.
