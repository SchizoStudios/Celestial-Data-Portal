# Sedna – The Deep Time Siren

---

## Interpretive Basis

**Mythic Root:**  
Inuit – Sedna is the sea goddess who rules over the Arctic depths. Betrayed and cast into the freezing ocean, she became the mother of sea creatures, dwelling in isolation at the bottom of the world. Her myth centers on abandonment, sacrifice, and the sovereignty of nature’s most remote reaches.

**Core Function:**  
Sedna governs **ancestral wounding and soul-deep endurance**. She embodies the parts of the psyche cast out, left in the cold, or held in suspended animation. She is the call of the farthest future and the most ancient memory.

**Astrological Role:**  
In charts, Sedna activates themes of **cosmic betrayal, exiled knowing, and longwave healing**. She may mark initiatory trauma that unfolds over a lifetime, or hidden treasures that only surface through surrender to vast processes.

## Use in Astrology Arith(m)etic
