# ♂ Mars – The Sacred Engine of Will

**Description:**
Mars is the force of raw initiation.  It rules desire, drive, direction, and decisive action — the yang pulse of the soul that propels energy into form.  As the spiritual muscle of the chart, Mars shows how the will operates when empowered… or when reactive.  It’s the spark that confronts, conquers, creates, or defends, depending on its alignment.

- *Natal Chart*: Mars reveals how you assert yourself, pursue goals, experience anger or desire, and engage with conflict.  It defines your battle style and your edge — how you hunt what you want.

- *Soul Path*: On a deeper level, Mars points to how the soul advances its evolutionary agenda through action and challenge.  It encodes karmic battles, sacred quests, and the path of courage.  Mars is how your spiritual fire gets tempered into purpose.

- *Transit Influence*: Mars transits initiate energy shifts, activations, and confrontation of stagnation.  They often spark new cycles, desires, conflicts, or territory claims — internal or external.

- *Progressed Expression*: Progressed Mars shows how your expression of desire, motivation, and boundaries matures over time.  It’s where anger becomes clarity, lust becomes longing, and impulse becomes strategy.

- *Mundane Astrology*: Mars governs the collective assertion of power — war, protests, sports, militant action, and raw passion.  It reveals what a population is willing to fight for or against.
