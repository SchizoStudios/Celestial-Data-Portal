Definition:

“Heliocentrically” refers to a model or perspective that places the Sun (Helios) at the center of the solar system, with all planetary bodies—including Earth—revolving around it. In heliocentric astrology, this means calculating planetary positions from the perspective of the Sun, not Earth.

• It removes Earth as the fixed observational point and treats it as one of many planetary energies.

• It offers a soul-level or cosmic view, often used in spiritual evolution tracking, solar consciousness alignment, and starseed mission decoding.

  

Contrast:

• Geocentric: Earth-centered (used in traditional astrology)

• Heliocentric: Sun-centered (used for mission-based or soul-aligned work)
