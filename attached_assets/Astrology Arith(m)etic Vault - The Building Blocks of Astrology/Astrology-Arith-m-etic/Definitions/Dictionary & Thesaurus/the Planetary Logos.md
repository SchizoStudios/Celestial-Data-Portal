Definition:

The Planetary Logos is the spiritual oversoul or divine intelligence of a planet â€” the archetypal blueprint and higher consciousness guiding its evolution and purpose.

- For Earth, the Planetary Logos is often synonymous with Gaia, though some teachings distinguish between Gaia as the embodied feminine life force and the Planetary Logos as the masculine mental/spiritual architecture of the planet.
- In esoteric traditions (Theosophy, Anthroposophy, mystery schools), the Logos is the divine Word or organizing principle that animates a planet as a living entity.
  

Think of it like this:

- The Sun is the Solar Logos (divine intelligence of the solar system)
- Earth is governed by the Planetary Logos (divine intelligence of Earth)
