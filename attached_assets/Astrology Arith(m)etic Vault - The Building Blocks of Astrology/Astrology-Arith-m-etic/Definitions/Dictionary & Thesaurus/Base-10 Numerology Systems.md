Base 10 numerology systems are number-based symbolic systems that revolve around the digits 1 through 9, with 10 seen as a return to 1 on a higher octave.  They interpret numbers as carriers of archetypal meaning, where each digit represents a core energy or principle:
- 1 = initiation, individuality
- 2 = duality, partnership
- 3 = creativity, expression
- 4 = structure, stability
- 5 = change, freedom
- 6 = harmony, responsibility
- 7 = introspection, wisdom
- 8 = power, mastery
- 9 = completion, transcendence
- 10 = renewal, spiritual rebirth

Calculations (like life path or destiny numbers) are done by reducing numbers to a single didgit unless a double digit master number (like 11 or 22) is considered significant.  The system is decimal-based because it aligns with human counting systems and is often used in both traditional numerology and esoteric disciplines (e.g., Kabbalah, Pythagorean systems).

**In Short:**
Base-10 numerology interprets the core energetic meanings of digits 1-9 in cycles, with 10 symbolizing the next tier of evolution.
