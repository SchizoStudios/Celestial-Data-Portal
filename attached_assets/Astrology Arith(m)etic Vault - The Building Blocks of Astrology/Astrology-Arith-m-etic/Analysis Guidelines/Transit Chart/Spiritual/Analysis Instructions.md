3. Track long cycles such as Saturn returns or the Uranus opposition for major awakening milestones.
4. Use eclipse seasons and lunations to pinpoint times of spiritual breakthroughs or resets.
5. Observe transits to 9th- and 12th-house planets for shifts in beliefs and spiritual service.
6. Monitor Neptune and Pluto retrograde stations for periods of deep introspection or surrender.
7. Integrate these transits with progressed insights to outline the bigger picture of spiritual evolution.
