# Comprehensive Transit Chart Analysis Instructions

1. Plot the current positions of all planets and compare them to natal placements.
2. Note exact aspects forming to natal planets or angles, focusing on conjunctions, squares, and oppositions for high impact.
3. Track slower-moving transits (Saturn onward) for long-term developmental phases.
4. Include faster transits of the Sun, Mercury, and Venus for short-term events and moods.
5. Assess the transiting Moon for daily fluctuations and triggers of major transits.
6. Monitor retrograde cycles to anticipate periods of review or delay.
7. Examine transits to progressed planets for additional layers of timing.
8. Synthesize timing and themes to provide an overall forecast, noting clusters of activity.
9. Offer practical suggestions for navigating challenging transits and maximizing opportunities.
