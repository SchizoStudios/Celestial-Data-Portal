# Transit Chart Overview

A transit chart maps current planetary positions against a natal chart. It reveals how present cycles stimulate personal themes and when key events may unfold. Transit analysis helps anticipate opportunities, challenges, and shifts as planets activate natal and progressed positions.

**Primary Uses**
- Track timing of opportunities, challenges, and shifts
- Monitor long-term transits of outer planets for major life stages
- Prepare for short-term triggers from faster-moving bodies
- Integrate transits with progressions for a nuanced forecast

Focus on exact aspects to natal planets or angles, especially conjunctions and hard aspects, to gauge intensity and duration of effects.
