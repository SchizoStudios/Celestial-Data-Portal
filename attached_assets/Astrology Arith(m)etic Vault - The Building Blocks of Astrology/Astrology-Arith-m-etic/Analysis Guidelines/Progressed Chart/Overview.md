# Progressed Chart Overview

Progressed charts follow symbolic movements of planets after birth to show personal evolution. They reveal internal shifts that unfold over time and complement outer-world events seen in [[Transit Chart|transits]]. Progressions highlight how a person grows beyond their natal blueprint and when significant life changes are likely to surface.

**Primary Uses**
- Trace maturation of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and personal planets
- Time periods of heightened development or crisis
- Correlate inner growth with external circumstances
- Forecast upcoming focus by watching sign and house shifts

Focus on progressed angles, lunation phases, and aspects to natal planets for clues about current life direction.
