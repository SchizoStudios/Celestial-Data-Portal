# Synastry Chart Overview

A synastry chart compares two [[Natal Chart|natal charts]] to reveal relationship potentials. Planetary contacts and house overlays highlight harmony, friction, and growth points between individuals. This technique is invaluable for understanding how two people stimulate each other's strengths and weaknesses.

**Primary Uses**
- Evaluate compatibility and attraction patterns
- Assess how one person's planets activate another's houses
- Identify supportive and challenging aspects for collaboration
- Explore karmic links through nodal or Vertex connections

Focus on tight conjunctions, major aspects, and nodal contacts for insight into shared lessons and chemistry.
