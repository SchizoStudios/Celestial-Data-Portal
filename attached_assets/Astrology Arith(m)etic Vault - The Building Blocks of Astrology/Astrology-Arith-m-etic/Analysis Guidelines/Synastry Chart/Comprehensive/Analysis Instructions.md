# Comprehensive Synastry Analysis Instructions

1. Compare both [[Ascendant]] signs and chart rulers to establish baseline compatibility.
2. Overlay each person's planets onto the other's houses to see which life sectors are stimulated.
3. Analyze conjunctions, oppositions, squares, trines, and sextiles between personal planets for attraction and communication patterns.
4. Include the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], Mercury, Venus, Mars, and outer planets for a full relational picture.
5. Consider aspects between one person's planets and the other's angles for meeting points of destiny.
6. Examine nodal contacts and vertex connections for karmic or fated undertones.
7. Check repeating themes across both charts, such as element or modality emphasis, for compatibility clues.
8. Note the role of synastry overlays on sensitive points like the 5th, 7th, and 8th houses.
9. Summarize areas of natural harmony along with potential friction points needing conscious effort.
10. Offer suggestions on how each partner can support the other's growth through the relationship dynamic.
