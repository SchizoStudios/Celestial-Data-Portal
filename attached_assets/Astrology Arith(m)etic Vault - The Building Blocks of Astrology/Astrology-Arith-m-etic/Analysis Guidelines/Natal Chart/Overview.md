# Natal Chart Overview

The natal chart is a snapshot of the heavens at a person's first breath. It maps the positions of the [[Planets (Classic and Modern)|planets]], [[Signs]], and [[Houses]] to outline innate potentials and life themes. By examining these placements we uncover the native's inherent strengths and challenges.

**Primary Uses**
- Understand personality structure and core motivations
- Reveal innate talents, challenges, and karmic patterns
- Provide a baseline for predictive techniques like [[Progressed Chart|progressions]] or [[Transit Chart|transits]]
- Determine where energies naturally flow or meet resistance through planetary dignity and house rulerships

Focus on planetary dignity, aspects, and house rulerships to see where energies naturally flow or meet resistance.
