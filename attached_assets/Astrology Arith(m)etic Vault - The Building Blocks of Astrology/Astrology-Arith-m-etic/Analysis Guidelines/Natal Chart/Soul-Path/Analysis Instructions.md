# Soul-Path Natal Chart Analysis Instructions

1. Begin with the [[North Node]] sign and house to identify the soul's evolutionary targets.
2. Examine the [[South Node]] for habits and skills carried over from the past.
3. Analyze the rulers of both nodes and any planets conjunct them for pivotal life missions.
4. Inspect the [[Midheaven]] and [[IC]] axis to see calling versus comfort zone influences.
5. Observe planets or points in aspect to the nodes—especially conjunctions, squares, and trines—to gauge karmic turning points.
6. Consider the placement of [[Chiron]], [[Part of Fortune]], or other spiritual indicators for deeper life lessons.
7. Track progressions and significant transits to the nodes to determine when the soul path is most active.
8. Explore supportive aspects among personal planets that aid purposeful growth and integration.
9. Conclude with a roadmap that empowers the individual to consciously align with their highest path.
