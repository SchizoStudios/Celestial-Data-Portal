# Money and Career

---

Astrology offers insights into financial habits and professional paths. Key indicators include:

- **Second House and its ruler:** Personal resources, values, and earning style.
- **Sixth House:** Daily work environment, service, and skills.
- **Tenth House and Midheaven:** Public reputation and career direction.
- **Planets involved with these houses** or making aspects to their rulers further refine interpretation.

## Practical Applications

1. Use transits and progressions to plan favorable times for job changes or financial moves.
2. Consider the sign of your Midheaven for clues about your ideal vocation.
3. Look at Venus and Jupiter for opportunities related to wealth and growth.

Astrology doesnâ€™t replace career counseling or financial planning, but it can highlight natural talents and cycles of opportunity.
