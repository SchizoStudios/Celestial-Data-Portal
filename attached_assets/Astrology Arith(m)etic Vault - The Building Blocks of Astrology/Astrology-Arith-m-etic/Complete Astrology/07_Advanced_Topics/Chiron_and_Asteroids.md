# Chiron and Asteroids

---

Beyond the major planets, many astrologers consider **Chiron** and selected asteroids for added nuance.

- **Chiron** represents the “wounded healer,” pointing to areas of vulnerability and potential mastery through healing.
- **Ceres, Juno, Pallas, and Vesta** are among the most commonly used asteroids. They symbolize themes of nurturing, partnership, wisdom, and devotion respectively.

While their influence is usually subtler than the main planets, these bodies can highlight key psychological themes in a chart.
