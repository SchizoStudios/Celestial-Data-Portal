# Decanates and Polarities

---

## Decanates

Each zodiac sign spans **30 degrees**. Astrologers divide these into three sections called **decanates**, each covering 10 degrees. Decanates fine-tune how a sign expresses itself:

1. **First Decan (0°–9°)** – strongest expression of the sign's core traits
2. **Second Decan (10°–19°)** – blends qualities of the sign with the traits of the following sign of the same element
3. **Third Decan (20°–29°)** – mixes in subtle influences from the next sign of the same element

Decanates help explain why two people with the same Sun sign can still display different flavors of that sign.

## Polarities

Signs are also paired into **opposing polarities** across the zodiac wheel. These polarities reflect complementary approaches to life:

- **Aries ↔ Libra** – Independence vs. partnership
- **Taurus ↔ Scorpio** – Security vs. transformation
- **Gemini ↔ Sagittarius** – Information vs. wisdom
- **Cancer ↔ Capricorn** – Nurturing vs. structure
- **Leo ↔ Aquarius** – Self-expression vs. collective ideals
- **Virgo ↔ Pisces** – Practicality vs. imagination

Polarities highlight the balancing act between each pair. Understanding them helps you see where you may seek equilibrium in your own chart.

## Applying These Concepts

When interpreting a planet or point in a chart:

1. Note the **degree** to determine the decan and any added flavors.
2. Consider the **polar sign** for greater context and potential tension or growth.

These subtle distinctions deepen chart analysis beyond just the basic sign meaning.
