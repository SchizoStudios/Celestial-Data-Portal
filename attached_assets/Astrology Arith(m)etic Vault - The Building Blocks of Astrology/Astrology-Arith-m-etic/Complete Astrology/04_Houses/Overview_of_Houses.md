# Overview of Houses

## What Are Houses?

In astrology, the **twelve houses** divide the sky into sections relative to the horizon and meridian at the time of birth. Each house represents a realm of life experience.

The houses rotate with Earth’s daily motion, so their positions depend on birthplace and time.

## The Four Angular Houses

1. **First House (Ascendant):** Self-image, appearance, personal approach
2. **Fourth House (IC):** Home, family, roots
3. **Seventh House (Descendant):** Partnerships, one-on-one interactions
4. **Tenth House (Midheaven):** Career, reputation, public life

These angles are powerful points that shape how a chart expresses itself.

## Succedent and Cadent Houses

- **Succedent houses** (2, 5, 8, 11) build upon what the angular houses start, relating to resources, creativity, shared assets, and long-term goals.
- **Cadent houses** (3, 6, 9, 12) involve learning, adjustment, and reflection.

Understanding the balance of planets among angular, succedent, and cadent houses reveals where you focus your energy.

## Interpreting House Emphasis

- Planets in a house activate that life area.
- Signs on house cusps describe your style within that domain.
- Empty houses still matter—you may experience those themes through their ruling planet’s placement.
