# Aspect Patterns and Configurations

---

When several aspects link multiple planets, they create recognizable **patterns**. These configurations describe recurring themes or talents in the chart.

Common patterns include:

- **T-Square:** Two planets in opposition both square a third planet, creating tension that seeks release.
- **Grand Trine:** Three planets form a triangle of trines, providing natural flow but sometimes a lack of motivation.
- **Yod (Finger of God):** Two planets sextile each other and both quincunx a third, indicating a focal point for major adjustments.
- **Grand Cross:** Four planets in square and opposition, creating dynamic challenges that demand action.

These patterns draw attention to specific life arenas and can help you understand complex interactions at a glance.
