# Major Aspects

---

The **major aspects** form the backbone of chart interpretation. They indicate strong connections between planets.

| Aspect | Degrees | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Conjunction | 0° | Intensifies planetary energies by blending them |
| Sextile | 60° | Easy opportunities and mutual support |
| Square | 90° | Internal conflict that spurs growth |
| Trine | 120° | Flowing harmony and natural talent |
| Opposition | 180° | Polarization that invites balance |

When interpreting, consider both planets involved and the signs/houses they occupy. A square between Mars and Saturn, for example, points to friction between action and caution, often manifesting as perseverance through challenges.
