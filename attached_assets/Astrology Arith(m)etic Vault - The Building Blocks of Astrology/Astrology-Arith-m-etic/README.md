> *“I want the legos of Astrology to be present in this codex.”*  
> — Mikah David Tanner Smith


I’m building this codex to collect, define, and refine the fundamental components of astrology — not only for human understanding, but also to train a Personal Assistant AI.

This system, which I call Astrology Arith(m)etic, is a structured breakdown of the essential “atoms” of astrology:
- [[Planets (Classic and Modern)]]
- [[Aspects]]
- Zodiac [[Signs]]
- Houses, Fixed Stars, Points, Harmonics, and more

These entries are crafted for dual purpose:
- To support students and practitioners of astrology
- To serve as foundational logic for training both living astrologers and machine learners

#### ✴ Codex Initiation

Before exploring the definitions and frameworks within *Astrology Arith(m)etic*, begin with the [[Codex Activation Invocation]].

This sets the tone, purpose, and protective field of the entire system. It is not optional — it is the spiritual root of the Codex.

📁 What’s Inside

I recommend beginning with the [[Definitions]] section — *after reading the license, of course.*

Inside you’ll find:
- Planetary and point definitions
- Aspect families and harmonic structures
- Fixed Star data
- Zodiac Sign Correspondences
- Esoteric bodies and symbolic layers

This is not just an archive.
It is a **living codex**: a system in motion, growing as I refine it.
