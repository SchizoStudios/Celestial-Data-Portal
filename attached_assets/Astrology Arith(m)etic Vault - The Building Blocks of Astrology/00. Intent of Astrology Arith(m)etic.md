Intent of ‘Astrology Arith(m)etic’ is to build a foundation and knowledge base of the arithmetic - also math, building blocks, fundamentals - that is put into a format that is easy to use and understand. 

This vault is intended for private use, by myself. It will be used by myself and any who carry on the legacy of my intent while retaining the pure spirit and essence behind the construct. 

The information entailed in this document, meaning more specifically Planets, is in reference to the Milky Way Galaxy Solar System. That being stated, the measurements of aspects and interpretations included in this Vault are applicable to other systems or declinations.

This project began Late May / Early June in 2025. I will make note of dates for various notable timeframes / timestables which will be kept record in the file “Notable Astrology Arithetic Progressions”.

  

### ✴️ Purpose of the Astrology Arith(m)etic Vault (Clarified)

Astrology Arith(m)etic is not a book of spells.

It is a living archive of energetic mechanics.

It defines the functional behavior of celestial currents — planets, stars, signs, aspects — not as authorities, but as tools and frequencies.

I use this codex to build magic and systems, not to obey tradition.

My interpretations are precise, practical, and sovereign.

I do not ask the sky what it means.

I define what I will do with its data.
