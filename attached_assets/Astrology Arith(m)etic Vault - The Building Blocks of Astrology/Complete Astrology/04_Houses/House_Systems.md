# House Systems

---

Different astrological traditions divide the houses in varying ways. The most common **house systems** include:

1. **Placidus** – Widely used in modern Western astrology; divides time between ascendant and midheaven.
2. **Equal House** – Each house is exactly 30°, starting from the Ascendant.
3. **Koch** – Similar to Placidus but adjusts for latitude and time of day.
4. **Whole Sign** – The simplest approach: the entire sign that contains the Ascendant becomes the first house, and the next sign becomes the second, and so on.

Choosing a house system often depends on personal preference, philosophical outlook, or the type of astrology practiced. No system is universally “correct.”

## Why House Systems Differ

Because Earth is a sphere and tilted on its axis, projecting the sky onto a flat chart involves choices about how to measure space and time. Each system handles these calculations differently, leading to variations in house cusps—especially at higher latitudes.

## How to Decide

- Experiment with several systems to see which resonates with your experiences.
- For beginners, Placidus or Whole Sign are popular starting points.
- Remember that interpretation skills matter more than the system itself.
