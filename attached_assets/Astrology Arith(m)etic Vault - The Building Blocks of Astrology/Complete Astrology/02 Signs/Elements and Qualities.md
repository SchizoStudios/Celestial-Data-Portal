## Why Elements and Qualities Matter

Every zodiac sign is defined by **two core attributes**:

- **Element:** Its fundamental nature and style of engagement.

## Application Tip

When you read a chart, always consider:

✅ What element the sign represents (what fuels it)  
✅ What modality the sign embodies (how it acts)

This helps you understand why two signs of the same element can feel so different.

For example:

- **Aries (Fire + Cardinal):** Fast-starting, pioneering action
- **Leo (Fire + Fixed):** Sustained creative energy
- **Sagittarius (Fire + Mutable):** Exploratory, adaptable enthusiasm
