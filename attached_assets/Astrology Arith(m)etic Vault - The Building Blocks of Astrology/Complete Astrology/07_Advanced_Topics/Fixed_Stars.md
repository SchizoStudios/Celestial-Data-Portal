# Fixed Stars

---

**Fixed stars** are prominent stars that appear stationary relative to the planets. Some carry mythological or historical significance in astrology.

Notable examples include **Regulus**, **Spica**, and **Algol**. When a planet closely aligns with a fixed star, it can modify that planet’s expression—adding fame, challenge, or specialized talent depending on the star’s nature.

Modern astrologers use fixed stars sparingly, focusing on tight orbs (often under 1°) for significant impact.
