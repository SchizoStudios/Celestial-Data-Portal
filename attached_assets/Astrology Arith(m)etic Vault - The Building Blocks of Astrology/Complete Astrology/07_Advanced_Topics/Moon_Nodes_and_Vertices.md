# Moon Nodes and Vertices

---

The **North Node** and **South Node** of the Moon mark points where the Moon’s orbit intersects the ecliptic. They represent karmic themes:

- **North Node** – Lessons to embrace; future growth.
- **South Node** – Past tendencies; comfort zone to balance with new experiences.

The **Vertex** is another calculated point often linked with fated encounters or significant relationships when activated by transits or synastry.
