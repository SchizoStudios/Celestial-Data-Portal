# Minor Aspects

---

In addition to major aspects, astrologers use **minor aspects** to fine-tune interpretations. Though subtler, they can reveal specialized talents or underlying tensions.

| Aspect | Degrees | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Semisextile | 30° | Mild friction or restlessness |
| Quincunx (Inconjunct) | 150° | Adjustment required between two unrelated energies |
| Semisquare | 45° | Irritation that pushes toward action |
| Sesquiquadrate | 135° | Similar to a square but less direct |
| Quintile | 72° | Creative or unusual talent |
| Biquintile | 144° | Amplified creative potential |

Minor aspects are often given smaller orbs than major aspects, since their effects are more nuanced.
