# Overview of Aspects

## What Are Aspects?

**Aspects** are the angular relationships between planets in a chart. They reveal how planetary energies interact—supportively, tensely, or somewhere in between.

Commonly used aspects include:

- **Conjunction (0°)** – Planets blend closely
- **Sextile (60°)** – Cooperative and opportunistic
- **Square (90°)** – Dynamic tension requiring action
- **Trine (120°)** – Natural harmony and ease
- **Opposition (180°)** – Polarized energy seeking balance

## Orbs

The exactness of an aspect is measured by its **orb** (difference in degrees from the exact angle). Smaller orbs indicate stronger influence. Each astrologer may use slightly different orb allowances, often wider for the Sun and Moon.

## Aspect Patterns

When multiple aspects connect three or more planets, they form **configurations** such as T-squares, Grand Trines, or Yods. These patterns highlight major themes within the chart.
