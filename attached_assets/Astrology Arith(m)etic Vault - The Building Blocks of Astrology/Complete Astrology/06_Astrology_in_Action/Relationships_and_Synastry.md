# Relationships and Synastry

---

**Synastry** compares the charts of two people to explore compatibility and interaction. Key factors include:

- **Aspects between personal planets** (Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars) which show attraction and potential friction.
- **House overlays,** indicating which areas of life the partner activates.
- **Composite or relationship charts** that combine both charts into one, revealing the partnership’s overall purpose.

Understanding these dynamics can highlight strengths and challenges in any relationship, whether romantic, familial, or professional.

## Tips for Chart Comparison

1. Look for harmonious aspects like trines and sextiles—they indicate ease of connection.
2. Note challenging aspects like squares or oppositions—they suggest growth areas.
3. Consider each person’s natal needs before judging compatibility.

No relationship is perfect; synastry helps you navigate differences with awareness.
