# How to Read a Chart

---

Interpreting a birth chart involves blending signs, houses, planets, and aspects into a coherent picture.

## Basic Steps

1. **Identify the Rising Sign.** This sets the house cusps and describes first impressions.
2. **Note Sun and Moon placements.** Together they reveal core drives and emotional needs.
3. **Examine planetary positions by sign and house.** This shows where each energy operates.
4. **Assess major aspects.** Look for conjunctions, squares, trines, etc., to understand how planets interact.
5. **Synthesize patterns.** Consider element balance, dominant modalities, and any aspect configurations.

Start with the broad strokes before diving into finer details. Over time, patterns will jump out more readily.
