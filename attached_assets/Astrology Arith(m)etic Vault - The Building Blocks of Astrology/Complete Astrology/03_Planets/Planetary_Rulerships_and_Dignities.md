## Dignity and Debility

Planets have varying levels of **dignity** depending on the sign they occupy:

- **Domicile (Rulership):** Planet is in its own sign and expresses comfortably.
- **Exaltation:** Planet is especially strong and positive.
- **Detriment:** Planet is opposite its rulership sign, expressing with some difficulty.
- **Fall:** Planet opposite its exaltation, feeling weakened or challenged.

These conditions help astrologers assess how easily a planet can operate within a chart.

## Applying Rulerships

- The ruler of your Ascendant is called the **chart ruler** and often describes your overall approach to life.
- Planetary dignities can show natural strengths or areas requiring extra effort.

Understanding these connections brings nuance to interpretation and reveals why certain placements feel comfortable while others require adjustment.
