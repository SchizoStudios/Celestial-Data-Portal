## What Is Retrograde?

In astrology, a planet is said to be **retrograde** when it appears to move backward through the zodiac from our vantage point on Earth. This optical illusion occurs because of the relative speeds and positions of Earth and the other planets.

Retrograde periods are times for review and reflection regarding the themes ruled by that planet.

## Key Retrograde Concepts

- **Mercury Retrograde** – Happens about three times per year, often linked with communication delays, technology hiccups, and the need to double-check details.
- **Venus Retrograde** – Occurs roughly every 18 months, prompting reassessment of relationships and personal values.
- **Mars Retrograde** – Every two years or so, influencing motivation, conflict, and how you assert yourself.
- **Outer Planet Retrogrades** – Jupiter through Pluto spend many months each year retrograde. Their effects are subtler, encouraging internalization of growth, discipline, or transformation.

During retrograde phases, astrologers advise slowing down, revisiting unfinished business, and avoiding major new commitments if possible.

## Interpreting Retrogrades in Charts

- A natal planet that is retrograde may indicate introspective tendencies or lessons that unfold over time.
- Transiting retrogrades highlight periods for course correction or revisiting the past.

Retrograde motion does not mean failure—rather, it calls for patience and a willingness to adjust your approach.
