## How This Material Is Organized

This directory is a **modular study guide** based on my own notes and summaries of the ideas presented in _Llewellyn’s Complete Book of Astrology_ by Kris Brandt Riske.

It is structured into sections covering:

- The Basics of Astrology
- The Signs of the Zodiac
- The Planets and Their Meanings
- The Houses and Life Areas
- Aspects and Planetary Relationships
- Practical Applications and Case Studies
- Advanced Topics (Chiron, asteroids, fixed stars)
- Additional Resources and Glossary

Each `.md` file focuses on a single topic or theme, making it easy to cross-reference or integrate into other systems.
