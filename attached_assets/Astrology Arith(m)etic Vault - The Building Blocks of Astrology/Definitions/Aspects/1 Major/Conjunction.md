**Aspect Degree:** 0
**Glyph:** ♂

**Description:**
A conjunction occurs when two planets or points occupy the same zodiacal degree (within an orb, usually up to ~8° but exact at 0°). This aspect blends and fuses the energies of both bodies, creating a potent and unified force. Unlike aspects that challenge or harmonize from a distance, the conjunction represents total integration—sometimes harmonious, sometimes tense, depending on the nature of the planets involved.

**KeyTraits:**
- Brings focus, intensity, and amplification of the combined planets.
- Can be constructive or destructive—the energies merge, so they must work together, willingly or not.
- Often marks important beginnings, initiations, or concentrated power.
- Feels like the two planets are sitting in the same room, fully aware of and influencing each other.

**Example Interpretation:**
Moon conjunct Mars: Emotional courage and quick temper; feelings (Moon) and action (Mars) tightly bound.
Venus conjunct Saturn: Love and commitment entwined; beauty (Venus) shaped by discipline (Saturn).

**Use in Practice:**
In charts, conjunctions are power centers. They demand attention because they dominate the field they occupy, often shaping a core part of personality (natal) or a significant event.
