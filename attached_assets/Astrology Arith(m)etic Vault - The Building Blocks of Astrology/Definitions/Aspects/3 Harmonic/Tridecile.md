**Aspect Degree:** 108
**Degree Orbs:** 1-2°
**Glyph:** 108° (No traditional glyph;  number itself is sacred in multiple systems)

**Description:**
The tridecile is a lesser-known aspect that occurs at 108.0 degrees, dividing the circle into 3/10.  It belongs to the quintile family and represents creative transcendence — often linked to sacred geometry, energetic mastery and inspired breakthrough.  The number 108 is revered in many spiritual traditions as a symbol of wholeness, completion, and cosmic alignment.
Astrologically, the tridecile suggests a refined frequency of intention or talent that may not emerge through ordinary practice.  It is the gift of attuned vision, often requiring integration of body, mind and spirit to express clearly.  This aspect may reflect a soul calling or signature of divine expression that manifests through harmony and discipline.

**Key Points:**
- Symbolizes creative transcendence and energetic mastery.
- Resonates with sacred geometry, divine proportion, and/or symbolic alignment.
- Can indicate a souls signature or gift with spiritual depth.
- Often reflects nonlinear expression of refined purpose or power.

**Example Interpretations:**
Mercury tridecile Neptune: Transcendent communication: channeling inspiration through language or thought.
Venus tridecile Jupiter: Expansive grace; spiritual elegance in love and/or the arts.

**Use in Practice:**
Trideciles are best interpreted with an ear to the spiritual o energetic resonance of a chart.  They don’t force themselves into view — they whisper through flow states, beauty, and symbolic meaning.  In High Craft, or metaphysical work, a tridecile can point to where sacred effort becomes divine output, and where devotion aligns with breakthrough.

Use this aspect to identify latent mystical skill sets, or where the native is attuned to reared currents of harmony and influence — often without consciously trying.
