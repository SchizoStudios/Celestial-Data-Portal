**Aspect Degree:** 36
**Degree Orbs:** 1°
**Glyph:** ✷ or custom decagon symbok

**Description:**
The decile forms at 36 degrees, representing one-tenth of the zodiacal circle. It’s part of the quintile family, but expresses itself in a more delicate, subtle form. While not widely emphasized in modern astrology, the decile is believed to signal refined creative awareness, minor talents and/or internal gifts waiting for structured application. 
It often shows where focused attention or subtle insight can lead to elegance, beauty, and/or harmonic expression. It’s sometimes described as a “minor creative mark” or a whisper of genius — a nudge toward mastery through quite refinement rather than bold innovation. 

**Key Points:**
- Signals small but meaningful creative and/or perceptive gifts. 
- Tied to inner-refinement, attention to detail, and/or sacred geometry. 
- Useful for identifying subconscious patterns of harmony and/or order. 
- May point to talents that emerge through routine, ritual, and/or discipline. 

**Uses in Practice:** 
Deciles work best when identified as Supporting notes int the symphony of a chart. They won’t dominate interpretation, but they whisper truths about what the native can refine, elevate, or spiritualize. In metaphysical work, a decile may guide you to focus on the small rituals, recurring details, or fine-tuned habits that shape character and/or creative output.
They also resonate well with sacred craftsmanship, numerology (especially base-10 systems), and/or practices involving precise repetition.
