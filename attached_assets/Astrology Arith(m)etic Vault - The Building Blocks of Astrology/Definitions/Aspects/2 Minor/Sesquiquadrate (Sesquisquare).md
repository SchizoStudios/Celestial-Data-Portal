**Aspect Degree:** 135
**Degree Orbs:** 1-3°
**Glyph:** ⚼

**Description:**
The sesquisquare (also called sesquiquadrate) occurs at 135 degrees. It’s like an extended semisquare and carries a similar vibe of irritation and testing, but often with more pronounced outer-world friction.
This aspect can represent persistent external agitation — energy that feels like it’s always “just off” or slightly disruptive.  It brings moments that test resilience, provoke irradiation, and/or demand adaptive responses, especially in social or work settings.

**Key Points:**
- External triggers that challenge your progress
- Requires patience and strategic effort
- Can cause restlessness or scattered focus

**Example**
Mercury sesquisquare Uranus: Mental tension, unexpected communication glitches. 

**Uses in Practice:**
Sesquiquadrates highlight persistent outer stressors — people, patterns, or circumstances that seem to “poke” at the chart-holder, asking for growth or adaptation.  They’re not explosive like squares, but their repeated friction grinds down or ways of functioning until new habits are formed.

In a metaphysical and energetic work, they may show up as aura noise, ambient irritation or recurring disruptions that invite energetic recalibration.  These aspects often ask: *How do you respond to pressure that doesn’t let up?* Answering that consciously can turn friction into fuel — irritation into initiation.
