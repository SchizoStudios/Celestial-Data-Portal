**Aspect Degree:** 45
**Aspect Orb:** 1-2°
**Glyph:** ◻︎

**Description:** 
A semisquare forms when two planets are 45 degrees apart. It’s a minor tension aspect, like a softened version of a square. It indicates internal friction, low-key irritation, ~~or~~ and/or nagging challenges that push for growth over time. 

**Key Points:**
- Subtle but persistent tension
- Feels like a background hum of discomfort that calls for action. 
- Can point to small obstacles or habits that need adjustment

**Example:**
Moon semisquare Saturn: Low-level emotional heaviness; inner pressure to “hold it together”

**Use in Practice:**
Semisquares ae excellent indicators of minor yet meaningful friction.  They point to patterns that aren’t overly destructive but wear on the psyche or body other time.  In natal charts, they suggest areas that require repeated attention, often involving habits, routines, or emotional reflexes that delay growth until consciously adjusted.

In metaphysical and spiritual practice, semisquares may correspond to energetic clutter, unconscious looping, or karmic micro-patterns.   Working with a semisquare involves tuning in, naming the friction, and choosing to evolve it through awareness, practice, and/or gentle disruption.
