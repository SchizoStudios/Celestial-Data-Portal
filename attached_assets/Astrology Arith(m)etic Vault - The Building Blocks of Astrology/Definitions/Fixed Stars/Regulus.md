Regulus – The Heart of the Lion (α Leonis)
Keywords: Sovereignty, Honor, Success, Noble Leadership

General Meaning:
Regulus, the brightest star in Leo, marks the heart of the Lion and is one of the four famed Royal Stars of Persia. Traditionally seen as the Watcher of the North, Regulus carries the essence of kingship, courage, and glory. Its influence is considered highly fortunate, bringing success, honor, and elevation to high status, but it always comes with the caveat: the fall from grace is as potent as the rise if integrity falters. Associated with Mars and Jupiter, Regulus merges courageous action with expansive growth.

High Expression:
	•	Promotes leadership, strength, and charismatic power.
	•	Brings opportunities for recognition, prestige, and material success.
	•	Inspires noble character, integrity, and protective guardianship.
	•	Supports self-mastery and bold pursuit of worthy goals.

Shadow Expression (to be aware of, not feared):
	•	Can amplify pride, arrogance, or over-identification with status.
	•	Risk of dramatic downfall if success is pursued without heart-centered integrity.
	•	May trigger ego conflicts or challenges to authority.
