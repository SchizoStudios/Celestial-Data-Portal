# Ixion – The Transgressor of Sacred Trust

---

## Interpretive Basis

**Mythic Root:**  
Greek – Ixion was a mortal king who committed unforgivable acts: betraying hospitality, murdering kin, and attempting to seduce Hera. As punishment, he was bound to an eternally spinning wheel. He embodies taboo transgressions and the price of violating cosmic law.

**Core Function:**  
Ixion governs **moral deviation, karmic blindness, and unrepentant cycles**. He reveals where humans violate sacred boundaries — either unconsciously or willfully — and the spiritual consequences of those actions.

**Astrological Role:**  
In charts, Ixion surfaces themes of **betrayal, consequence, and distorted desire**. His influence can signal either inherited transgressions or current temptations to ignore moral instinct in favor of unchecked drive.
