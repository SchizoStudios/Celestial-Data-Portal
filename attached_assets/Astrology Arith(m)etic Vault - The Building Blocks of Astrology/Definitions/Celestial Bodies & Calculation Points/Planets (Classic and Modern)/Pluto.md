# ♇ Pluto – The Gatekeeper of Power and Rebirth

**Description:**
Pluto governs the forces of death, transformation, power, and regeneration. It is the planet of alchemical change — ruling over everything hidden, buried, taboo, or suppressed. Where Pluto moves, there is either breakdown or breakthrough.  It strips away illusion, purges rot, and reshapes identity from the ashes.

- *Natal Chart*: Pluto reveals your source of inner power, primal fear, and hidden compulsion.  It shows where transformation is inevitable — where you are stripped down to rebuild stronger, wiser, and more sovereign.

- *Soul Path*: PLuto represents karmic shadow work and soul-level contracts involving control, trauma, survival, and transmutation.  It is tied to past-life intensity and your deep evolutionary edge — often carrying a collective or ancestral dimension.

- *Transit Influence*: Pluto transits are slow, profound, and [[irrevocable]].  They destroy what no longer serves, often through intense or painful events.  They also initiate profound rebirth, reclamation of power, and alignment with soul truth.

- *Progressed Expression*: Progressed Pluto reveals the evolving nature of your inner underworld — how your soul learns to wield power ethically, navigate darkness, and undergo psychic initiations.

- *Mundane Astrology*: Pluto governs [[systemic collapse]], mass transformation, collective trauma, war, and nuclear energy.  It reveals the hidden forces shaping society — economics, psychology, shadow power, and collective rebirth.
