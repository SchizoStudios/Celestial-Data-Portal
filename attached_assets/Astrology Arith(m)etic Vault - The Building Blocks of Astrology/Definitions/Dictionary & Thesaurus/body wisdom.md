Definition:

“Body wisdom” is the innate intelligence of the physical form — the subtle awareness, instinct, and memory carried in tissues, cells, breath, and posture. It is how the soma (body) communicates truth beyond the intellect.

  

Key Features:

  

- Felt-sense knowing (gut feeling, tension, ease)
- Somatic responses to spiritual insight or trauma
- Deep memory stored in muscles, bones, or nerves (often linked to ancestral or karmic imprints)

  

  

It’s the reason we say things like “my body just knew” or “I feel it in my bones.” In astrology, the Earth (or Moon) often governs body wisdom and somatic memory.
