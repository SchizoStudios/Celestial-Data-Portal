Definition:

Systemic collapse refers to the failure or breakdown of an entire interconnected system, rather than just a single part. It occurs when foundational structures — such as economic, political, ecological, or spiritual frameworks — are no longer able to function due to internal weaknesses, accumulated stress, or external shock.

  

Characteristics:

- Cascading failures across multiple domains
- Inability to adapt or self-correct
- Often precedes deep transformation or rebirth


Astrological Context (Pluto & Uranus):

- Triggered during Pluto transits to major national or institutional points
- Often aligned with Uranus when the collapse comes suddenly, or Neptune when it is slow and dissolving
- May be collective, ancestral, or personal (e.g., collapse of egoic structures)


Examples:

- The fall of empires or currencies
- Widespread ecological breakdown
- Loss of trust in legal or religious institutions
- Personal: a full ego death, breakdown of false identity, or collapse of internal coping systems
