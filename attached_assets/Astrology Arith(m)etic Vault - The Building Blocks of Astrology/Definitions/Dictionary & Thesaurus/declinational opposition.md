Alright—let’s get right to it, no fluff.

Declination Opposition in astrology is a specific type of parallel aspect but measured by declination, not by zodiac degree.

Here’s the simplest breakdown:

✅ Declination:
- This is the distance north or south of the celestial equator (kind of like celestial latitude).
- Every planet has a declination value between about +23.5° and –23.5° (the limits of the ecliptic).  

✅ Declination Opposition (Contra-Parallel):
- Occurs when *two planets have the same degree of declination but in opposite hemispheres—one north and one south.

For example:  
  Venus at +20° declination (20° North)
  Mars at –20° declination (20° South)

- This mirrors the idea of an opposition by zodiac degree, but measured in declination rather than longitude.

✅ Orb:
- Typically a tight orb is used (often 1° or less).

✅ Interpretation:
- Like a zodiacal opposition, it symbolizes tension, polarity, and awareness, but it operates energetically in the declination dimension.
- Think of it as a “mirror tension,” contrasting the two planetary energies across the celestial equator.

✅ Related Declination Aspect:
- Parallel: Same degree of declination on the same side (both north or both south), acting like a conjunction in strength.
- Contra-Parallel: Same degree of declination but opposite sides—this is what you’re calling a declination opposition.

So in short:

Declination Opposition (Contra-Parallel)
= Two bodies at the same declination but opposite hemispheres (N/S).
= Tension, polarity, similar to an opposition by longitude.
