Definition:
The Etheric Template is the fifth layer of the human energy field (aura) in many esoteric systems. It is a blueprint-like energetic grid that holds the perfect form of the physical body — like a sacred architectural mold for matter.

Structure (in auric anatomy):

1. Etheric Body – life-force grid connected to the body
2. Emotional Body – feelings and mood vibrations
3. Mental Body – thoughts and beliefs
4. Astral Body – bridge to the soul/others
5. Etheric Template – divine mold of the physical form

Function:

- Holds the ideal template for physical health
- Links the sound field and sacred geometry of the soul to the body
- Often activated during sound healing, deep meditation, or planetary Uranian transits


Symbolic Role (Astrology Arith(m)etic):

Planets like Uranus and Neptune may interact with this layer to reformat, awaken, or rewrite your incarnational design from a divine schematic.
