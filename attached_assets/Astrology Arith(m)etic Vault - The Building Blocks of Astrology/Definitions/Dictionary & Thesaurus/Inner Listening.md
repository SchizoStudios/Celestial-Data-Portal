Inner listening is the. Act of tuning into one’s subtle internal awareness, beyond surface thoughts or emotional noise. It’s not just introspection — it’s a quite attunement to the deeper intelligence within:
your body’s wisdom, your soul’s signal, ~~or~~ and/or your intuitive voice.

It often involves:
- Pausing mental chatter to hear what lies beneath
- Sensing rather than analyzing
- Receiving impressions, symbols, or emotional truths
- Trusting insights that arrive without external validation
- Letting the body, heart, ~~or~~ and/or spirit speak before the mind

Inner listening is used in ritual, healing, creation, and decision-making.  It’s especially vital in High Craft, where the next step, phrase, note, or shape often arises a not from logic but from resonance.

**In Short:**
Inner listening is the practice of hearing from within — an act of receptivity to the soul’s whisper, the body’s knowing, and/or the unseen threads guiding creation.
