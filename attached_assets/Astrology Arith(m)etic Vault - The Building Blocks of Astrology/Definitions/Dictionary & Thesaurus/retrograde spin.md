Definition:
A retrograde spin refers to a planet rotating on its axis in the opposite direction of most other planets in the solar system. Most planets spin counterclockwise (prograde) when viewed from above the Sun’s north pole. A retrograde planet spins clockwise.

Uranus and Venus both have retrograde axial spins:

- Uranus: Tilted nearly 98°, it spins almost on its side, creating extreme seasonal effects and unique magnetic behavior.
- Symbolic Meaning: Reversals, atypical rhythm, challenge to linear progression, and alternate perception of time and motion.

Astrological Significance:
Retrograde spin in a planetary archetype suggests nonconformity, upended structure, and a deeply internalized or reversed expression of the planet’s energy.
