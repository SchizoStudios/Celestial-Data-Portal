Definition:

“Primordial” means existing from the beginning of time — original, ancient, and foundational. It refers to forces, beings, or states of consciousness that precede structure, form, and history.

Examples in context:

- Primordial gods = the first archetypal forces (e.g., Chaos, Gaia)
- Primordial waters = the cosmic ocean before creation
- Primordial memory = soul-deep remembrance beyond linear time
  

In essence: Primordial means pre-human, pre-language, raw and source-aligned.
