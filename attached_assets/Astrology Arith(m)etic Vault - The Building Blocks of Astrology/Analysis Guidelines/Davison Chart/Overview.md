# Davison Chart Overview

The [[Davison]] chart merges two birth dates and locations into a single midpoint chart. It treats the relationship itself as an entity, revealing shared purpose and experiences that arise when two people interact. This method complements synastry by showing the energy of the bond as its own horoscope.

**Primary Uses**
- Explore a relationship's joint mission or destiny
- Pinpoint events and themes that bind two lives together
- Study the couple's composite strengths and challenges
- Forecast future developments by applying transits to the Davison chart

Focus on angles, luminary placement, and patterns repeating from each individual's natal chart to understand the union's core dynamic.
