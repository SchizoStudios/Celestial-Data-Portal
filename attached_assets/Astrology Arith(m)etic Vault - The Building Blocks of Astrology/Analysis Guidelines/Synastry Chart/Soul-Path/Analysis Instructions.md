3. Evaluate Saturn contacts for karmic responsibilities or agreements requiring mutual commitment.
4. Review overlays of the 9th and 12th houses to see how spiritual paths intersect.
5. Note progressions and significant transits that trigger nodal or Vertex connections for timing milestones.
6. Look for repeating themes with asteroids like [[Chiron]] or [[Pallas]] for guidance and wisdom.
