# Comprehensive Progressed Chart Analysis Instructions

1. Calculate secondary progressions for all planets, angles, and sensitive points from the natal chart.
2. Track the progressed [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] to identify shifts in identity and emotional focus.
3. Note when progressed planets change sign or house to mark new developmental phases.
4. Observe aspects formed between progressed planets and natal placements, especially conjunctions and hard aspects.
5. Include slower progressions of outer planets to capture subtle generational influences.
6. Examine progressed angles for changes in environment or public orientation.
7. Evaluate the progressed lunation cycle relative to the natal Sun for timing peaks and turning points.
8. Cross-reference significant progressions with current [[Transit Chart|transits]] for enhanced predictive accuracy.
9. Summarize the progression story, highlighting emerging priorities and inner growth themes.
